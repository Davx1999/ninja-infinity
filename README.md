Infinity for Ninja

This modded extension allows you to use the famous Infinity on Ninja, even if you have more than one account in the same universe.

Data of each player are saved in separate storages but maintains the structure of the original extension, so that data can be imported/exported, even in sync with Pantry.

The code in this repository is not minified and reflects the original structure, in the releases you can find ready-to-use versions for Chrome/Edge and Firefox
